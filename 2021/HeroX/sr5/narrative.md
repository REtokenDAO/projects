# Narrative

## Problem

### Hardware
Currently most newly constructed homes in America are not built with American Made solar technology.

### Software


## Solution

### Hardware
Improve the adoption of cutting-edge American Made solar technolog by creating "next-gen" subdivisions called TokenTown.  We will also deploy bitcoin mining hardware and/or other blockchain server infrastructure that will make use of the extra energy generated from this net positive energy subdivision.

### Software
Through the creative capitalization using Digital Assets / Security tokens this will allow the up-front costs of solar technology to be managable by the occupants of these dwellings.  By deploying TokenTown in designated Opportunity Zones (US Census tracts) this will also allow additional capital through Qualified Opportunity Funds.

## Team

## Plan

### Create Github Repo / Project Page
> *You are here!!*

### Create a REtoken Improvement Proposal (RIP) on Snapshot.org
Using REtoken DAO's Governance Process, create a new REtoken Improvement Proposal (RIP) on [Snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/retokendao.eth/) ([see Trello Card for details](https://trello.com/c/eEjmRbTF))

### TokenTown - Working Groups
Propose that whomever participates in these working groups will be rewarded 50 $RETOKEN for each working group.  This is similar to previous working groups that REtoken DAO has held.  These token distributions will be itemized within the "Weekly TDP" (TDP = Treasury Distribution Proposal).

### Proposed Schedule: TokenTown - Working Groups
> Naming Convention:
> 
> tt = "TokenTown" / 0 (for "Season 0) / wg = "working group" / # = what number of working group

* tt0wg1 | Mon 5-7p EDT / 27Sep2021
* tt0wg2 | Thu 5-7p EDT / 30Sep2021
* tt0wg3 | Fri 4-6p EDT / 01Oct2021
* tt0wg4 | Fri 9-11p EDT / 01Oct2021
* tt0wg5 | Sat 3-5p EDT / 02Oct2021
* tt0wg6 | Sat 9-11p EDT / 02Oct2021
* tt0wg7 | Sun 3-5p EDT / 03Oct2021
* tt0wg8 | Mon 5-7p EDT / 04Oct2021

> **NOTE:**
> *We may not need all 6 of these working groups.  Goal is to have all requirements finalized for submission by 10p EDT on 04Oct2021.*
