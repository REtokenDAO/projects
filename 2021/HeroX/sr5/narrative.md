# Narrative
<img src="https://trello.com/1/cards/613a47499073e135adfb6d08/attachments/614955b3bf0316504bd434dd/previews/614955b4bf0316504bd434e5/download/image.png" width=300 align=right>

# Problem

## Hardware
Unfortunately today, most new homes get built without using the latest American-Made solar technology.  Lack of adoption in underserved neighborhoods due to cost of installation of solar technology.

## Software
Initial capital is the biggest barrier for the proliferation of American Made solar technology.  New subdivisions being created are still done using antiquated methodologies without any technology.

# Solution

## Hardware
Improve the adoption of cutting-edge American Made solar technolog by creating "next-gen" subdivisions called TokenTown.  We will also deploy bitcoin mining hardware and/or other blockchain server infrastructure that will make use of the extra energy generated from this net positive energy subdivision.

## Software
Through the creative capitalization using Digital Assets / Security tokens this will allow the up-front costs of solar technology to be managable by the occupants of these dwellings.  By deploying TokenTown in designated Opportunity Zones (US Census tracts) this will also allow additional capital through Qualified Opportunity Funds.
