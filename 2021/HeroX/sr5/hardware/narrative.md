Unfortunately today, most new homes get built without using the latest American-Made solar technology. Lack of adoption in underserved neighborhoods is the highest due to the cost of installation of solar technology. Our position is that builders don't have a financial incentive to plan intentional solar-based communities and most families don't have ready access to the capital. We are solving both sides of the incentive and capital stack, and doing it in a net-positive energy solution.

In Denver in 2021, the average home sold for over $651,000 (source: Colorado Association of Realtors) and the average solar installation was $13,000-18,000 (source: energysage.com). Rent is predicted to increase another 25% from its already high average of over $1,800 a month. For most families, solar installations are simply out of reach. Additionally, only 4.18% of Colorado's current power comes from solar. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has previously stated he would like fully renewable energy in place by 2040. 

Our solution turns entire neighborhoods into microgrids with advanced capabilities. This is the bridge to get there.

# Solution
[<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/poapmedia/tokentowndao-livestream-exclusive-poap-for-streamyard-participants-2021-logo-1633392258356.png" width=275 align=right>](https://github.com/REtokenDAO/projects/tree/main/2021/HeroX/sr5/hardware)

Improve the adoption of cutting-edge American Made solar technology by creating "next-gen" subdivisions called TokenTown. TokenTown is going to be a model neighborhood we can deploy all over the country.

Every building in TokenTown will be built using the best American-Made solar solutions for these reasons:
1) Extra energy generated within the TokenTown micro-grid can be utilized by higher consuming buildings. This promotes community effeciencies and synergy while maintaing low costs;
2) Net positive energy will be used to power bitcoin, crypto mining operations and other blockchain infrastructure that provides returns in the form of digital assets or cryptocurrency.
3) Digital assets generated through crypto mining operations can be used to offset rent or mortgage costs.
> This self-contained cycle is sustainable, affordable, and perpetual which can provide affordable housing and most important to us, use solar power to turn renters into owners. Even after accounting for the mining operations, we expect our solar deployment to end up net energy positive.

We will deploy this TokenTown model in Colorado within an opportunity zone. We will continue to focus future TokenTown deployments in designated Opportunity Zones (OZ) as well. The initial parcel will be in sunny Colorado which is renowned for over 300 days of sunshine a year. Opportunity Zones are identified urban and rural initiatives chosen by every Governor. By emphasizing solar and providing non-traditional capital through security tokens, we expect a high number of our community members will be people of color, single mothers, and LGBTQ.

TokenTown will likely be capitalized through a series of SEC registered Regulation Crowdfunding (RegCF) offerings with security tokens using a variety of FinTech partners to increase exposure to this unique opportunity. Two of our team members have prior experience launching a RegCF offering which they brought to market in March 2020.

# Accomplishments and Team

## Team Summary
Our diverse leadership team includes people of color, women, single parents, and a person with a disability. We represent a multi-state team from CA, NY, PA, TN, NC, TX and CO. We have a variety of technical expertise in real estate, renewable energy, institutional finance, IT, blockchain, decentralized finance, and community building. In just the 10 days we've been aware of this challenge, we've grown a community of over 150 people interested in being part of this effort. We are currently launching a governance NFT (non-fungible token) limited to 32 at 1 Ethereum (~$3,400) each, as social proof that there is a high demand for this type of housing. We launched two DAOs in Wyoming (REtoken DAO and TokenTown DAO) and minted new social tokens. We held 11 working groups, wrote our plan, got partner vision buy in, and laid out a plan to solve solar-based affordable housing in the US. Leading CEOs in this space are excited to recommend our project.

We were recently asked to submit a white paper regarding this project to be featured at a leading investment conference in December, 2021, and asked to join several exclusive masterminds for thought leadership.

# Plan

## Ready! [R5]

Additionally, we are connecting with American made solar solutions partners who are equipped to help us install an entire new community, reviewing SEC and FINRA requirements for this type of offering and interviewing potential vendors and transfer agents. We're in discussion with a Colorado based home builder with capacity for TokenTown who can deliver quality construction for significantly lower prices than standard construction. We're reviewing local permitting and zoning requirements to maximize potential income opportunities for community members. We are already a functioning Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a legal business structure that allows for democratized governance and are familiar with the infrastructure needed to support it. We are also in talks with the largest Opportunity Zone Fund consultant in the US, who is in support of our effort.

After we raise our social proof governance round, we expect to finalize our Solar Solution partners, identify and purchase land in a Colorado OZ, finalize a contract with a construction vendor, complete all necessary permitting, and continue our ongoing dialogue with community members and other local stakeholders. We also hope to finalize the model that we can replicate across the United States.

### TokenTown - Working Groups
> *Propose that whomever participates in these working groups will be rewarded 50 $RETOKEN for each working group.  This is similar to previous working groups that REtoken DAO has held.  These token distributions will be itemized within the "Weekly TDP" (TDP = Treasury Distribution Proposal).*
