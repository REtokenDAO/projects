Unfortunately today, most new homes get built without using the latest American-Made solar technology. Lack of adoption in underserved neighborhoods is the highest due to the cost of installation of solar technology. Our position is that builders don't have a financial incentive to plan intentional solar-based communities and most families don't have ready access to the capital. We are solving both sides of the incentive and capital stack, and doing it in a net-positive energy solution.

In Denver in 2021, the average home sold for over $651,000 (source: Colorado Association of Realtors) and the average solar installation was $13,000-18,000 (source: energysage.com). Rent is predicted to increase another 25% from its already high average of over $1,800 a month. For most families, solar installations are simply out of reach. Additionally, only 4.18% of Colorado's current power comes from solar. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has previously stated he would like fully renewable energy in place by 2040. 

Our solution turns entire neighborhoods into microgrids with advanced capabilities. This is the bridge to get there.

# Solution
[<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/poapmedia/tokentowndao-livestream-exclusive-poap-for-streamyard-participants-2021-logo-1633392258356.png" width=275 align=right>](https://github.com/REtokenDAO/projects/tree/main/2021/HeroX/sr5/hardware)

Improve the adoption of cutting-edge American Made solar technology by creating "next-gen" subdivisions called TokenTown. These TokenTowns are community owned and operated, architected on a globally scalable model.

Every building in TokenTown will be built using the best American-Made solar solutions for these reasons:
1) Extra energy generated within the TokenTown micro-grid can be utilized by higher consuming buildings. This promotes community effeciencies and synergy while maintaing low costs;
2) Net positive energy will be used to power bitcoin, crypto mining operations, and other blockchain infrastructure that provides returns in the form of digital assets or cryptocurrency;
3) Digital assets generated through crypto mining operations will be applied to increase housing affordability for residents.
> Using solar power, the TokenTown model is sustainable, affordable, and perpetual. This results in the change to the underlying narrative in these Opportunity Zones.  This ultimately creates affordable housing for TokenTown residents.

We will deploy this initial TokenTown model in an Opportunity Zone (OZ) in Colorado, which is renowned for over 300 days of sunshine a year. We will continue to focus future TokenTown deployments in designated OZs as well. By emphasizing solar and providing non-traditional capital through security tokens, we expect a diverse community including historically under-represented populations.

TokenTown will likely be capitalized through a series of SEC registered Regulation Crowdfunding (RegCF) offerings with security tokens using a variety of FinTech partners to increase exposure to this unique opportunity. Two of our team members have prior experience launching a RegCF offering which they brought to market in March 2020.

# Accomplishments and Team


## Team Summary
Our diverse leadership team includes people of color, women, single parents, and a person with a disability. We represent a multi-state team from CA, NY, PA, TN, NC, TX and CO. We have a variety of technical expertise in real estate, renewable energy, institutional finance, IT, blockchain, decentralized finance, and community building.

The recent excitement surrounding this TokenTown project and our team's submission for the American-Made Solar Prize has resulted in continued community growth at an unprecedented rate.  During the past few weeks, through the intense efforts working on this project, our community has continued to grow beyond 150 people.

# Plan

## Ready! [R5]

Additionally, we are connecting with American made solar solutions partners who are equipped to help us install an entire new community, reviewing SEC and FINRA requirements for this type of offering and interviewing potential vendors and transfer agents. We're in discussion with a Colorado based home builder with capacity for TokenTown who can deliver quality construction for significantly lower prices than standard construction. We're reviewing local permitting and zoning requirements to maximize potential income opportunities for community members. We are already a functioning Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a legal business structure that allows for democratized governance and are familiar with the infrastructure needed to support it. We are also in talks with the largest Opportunity Zone Fund consultant in the US, who is in support of our effort.

After we raise our social proof governance round, we expect to finalize our Solar Solution partners, identify and purchase land in a Colorado OZ, finalize a contract with a construction vendor, complete all necessary permitting, and continue our ongoing dialogue with community members and other local stakeholders. We also hope to finalize the model that we can replicate across the United States.

### TokenTown - Working Groups
REtoken has a winning track record of using a series of working groups to accomplish various projects.  This includes their initial "Tokenomics Working Groups" as well as their Gitcoin DGov Hackathon Working Groups (which resulted in team winning Grand Prize of that hackathon).
