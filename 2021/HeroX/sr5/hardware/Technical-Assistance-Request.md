## Hardware Track | American-Made Solar Prize Round 5

## TokenTown | a Next-Gen Solar Powered Community
REtoken | The Real Estate DAO is an online community.  We will leverage the power and speed of our growing online community, crowdfunding, digital assets & securities, and various marketing strategies to bring mainstream adoption of the latest American-Made solar technologies to market while architecting a solution that will be truly community owned and operated.

Through our full transparency founding principle, there will no longer be the question:
> *"is deploying solar technology worth it?".*

We are interested in having conversations with various solutions partners (home builders, leading solar solutions provides, etc) that will allow reduction of costs, speed-to-market, increased energy density of solar technology, etc.
