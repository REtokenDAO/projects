## Software Track | American-Made Solar Prize Round 5

## TokenTown | a Next-Gen Solar Powered Community
REtoken | The Real Estate DAO is an online community.  We will leverage the power and speed of our growing online community, crowdfunding, digital assets & securities, and various marketing strategies to bring mainstream adoption of the latest American-Made solar technologies to market while architecting a solution that will be truly community owned and operated.

Through our full transparency founding principle, we will answer the question:
> *"is deploying solar technology worth it?".*

We are interested in having conversations with various solutions partners:
* Energy distribution, monitoring solutions
* Qualified Opportunity Zone Funds
* SEC/FINRA Registered: Broker-Dealers <RegCF>, Registered Transfer Agents, Alternative Trading Systems <ATS>
* Various investor fullfillment servies: KYC/AML, investor onboarding, etc
